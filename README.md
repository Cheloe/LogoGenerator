# LogoGenerator
Generate custom SVG logos from command line prompts

TODO: 
- make Shapes.drawshape() pull "this" from  the proper scope
- create a function that takes in the svg string from drawshape(), and renders it properly as an svg shape
- control user input for shape size, color, etc. so they can't create a crazy logo.
- make sure test for shape works properly. 
- update readme with instructions on how to use the program
- figure out how to save the svg file to a the exaples folder rather than the root directory
