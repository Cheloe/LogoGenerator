# LogoGenerator
Generate custom SVG logos from command line prompts

## Here's What I did:
- Wrote Inquirer prompts to capture user preferences
- Created a Shapes class that captures color and letter options common to all shapes
- Created Triangle, Square, and Circle classes that return svg code acc to choice
- Wrote test for the shapes class to check that the object works as expected
- Wrote tests for the triangle, square, and circle classes to make sure objects behave as expected
- Wrote and formatted README
- Created video of the app in action
