# LogoGenerator
Generate custom SVG logos from command line prompts

## Here's What I did:
- Wrote Inquirer prompts to capture user preferences
- Created a class called shapes that captures user input and renders it to an SVG file
- Wrote tests for the shapes class to check that the object works as expected and that the svg file is created as expected
- Wrote method on the shapes class to style each shape properly
- Wrote method on the shapes class that renders custom colors because browser defaults are ugly
- Wrote and formatted README
- Created video of the app in action

Demo videos of the app in action are in the `demos` folder
